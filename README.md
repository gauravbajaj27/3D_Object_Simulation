# 3D Objects Simulation
- The project is based on modeling as well as the movement of 3D objects like cube, cuboid, and pyramid when linear transformations are applied to them. The project illustrates the implementation of different transformations such as rotation, shearing, translation, shearing, mirroring, scaling, and the inverse of these transformations.

- Although there are many projects available and developed where these operations are performed these are automated but we have taken into consideration the userâ€™s input and the program creates the object as per the input by the user about the object choice, vertices of the objects as well as the value of factors involved in the transformations as per the user choice. Our program allows the user to see the real-time effects of the transformations chosen by the user in the previous step. This also makes users understand how these transformations work and make the user crystal clear about the linear algebra concepts which are used to develop and apply these types of transformations as well as the effect of SVD and inverse of a transformation.
